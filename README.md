# Poll Maker

Poll Maker is a web service created in PHP, CSS and JavaScript. 

## Description

On the website you can create your own profile, vote on existing polls or even create a poll to see others' opinion on a topic.

## How to use

### Voting

If you scroll down, there are two sections on the page: available and expired polls. At the top you can see the available polls - you can still vote on these.

Below them are the expired ones - unfortunately you cannot vote on these anymore but you can view the results of these polls.
